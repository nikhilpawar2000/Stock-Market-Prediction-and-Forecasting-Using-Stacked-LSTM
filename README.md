# Stock-Market-Prediction-and-Forecasting-Using-Stacked-LSTM

Description:
Developed a robust and scalable model to predict stock market prices using Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This project leverages deep learning techniques to analyze historical stock data and forecast future trends, providing valuable insights for investors and financial analysts.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed historical stock data, handling missing values and normalizing the dataset for better model performance.
Model Development: Implemented a Stacked LSTM model to capture temporal dependencies and enhance prediction accuracy.
Visualization: Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize stock price trends and model predictions, providing clear and interpretable insights.
Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), ensuring reliable and accurate forecasts.
Technologies Used:

Libraries: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
Algorithms: Stacked LSTM, Data Normalization, Time Series Analysis
